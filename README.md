# Cryptocurrency Data Processing Application

This application is designed to load historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) and market cap data for cryptocurrencies from CSV files and save it to a SQLite database. It then fetches new data daily using the Selenium library in Python, scheduled through Windows Task Scheduler.

Throughout the project's steps, the data is processed, cleaned, and new calculations are applied to analyze cryptocurrency market data. The application retrieves data from a source, aggregates it with existing data in the database, performs calculations, and saves the results back to the database. The application is built using Python and utilizes several libraries for data handling and logging.
